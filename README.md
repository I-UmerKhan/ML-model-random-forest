I learned how to use Random Forest, a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting. Random Forest is useful because it provides robust predictions by averaging the results of various trees, which reduces the variance and improves the model's generalization to unseen data. It can handle large datasets with higher dimensionality and offers insights into feature importance, making it a versatile tool for both classification and regression tasks. Additionally, Random Forest is relatively easy to use and tune, making it an excellent choice for many machine learning applications.
